# Guest Search Implementation Summary

## **Objective**
Create a complete guest (unauthenticated) search experience that mirrors the authenticated user experience, allowing visitors to browse rental listings without signing up, while strategically prompting for authentication at key interaction points.

## **What We Built**

### **1. Guest Trip Flow**
- **Guest Sessions**: Created session-based storage system (`guest-session.ts`) for unauthenticated users
- **Dual Storage**: Sessions stored in both sessionStorage (client) and cookies (server) for RSC compatibility
- **Guest Trip Creation**: Modified home page search to create guest sessions instead of requiring auth
- **Routing**: Guest searches go to `/guest/rent/searches/[sessionId]` (public route)
- **Server-Side Conversion**: When guests sign in, conversion happens server-side with instant redirects (no loading spinners)

### **2. Guest Search Experience**
- **Complete UI Replica**: Carbon copy of `/app/rent/searches/[tripId]` for guests
- **Real Database Listings**: Guests see actual property listings using `pullGuestListingsFromDb`
- **Interactive Map**: Full map functionality with markers, filtering, and property details
- **Tab Navigation**: Recommended, All Listings, Favorites, Matches tabs
- **Database Persistence**: Guest likes/dislikes persist to database and migrate when users sign up

### **3. Database Schema Changes**
- **Optional Foreign Keys**: Modified Prisma schema to support both guest and authenticated users
  ```prisma
  model Favorite {
    tripId          String?  // Optional - for authenticated users
    guestSessionId  String?  // Optional - for guest users
    @@unique([guestSessionId, listingId])
  }

  model Dislike {
    tripId          String?  // Optional - for authenticated users
    guestSessionId  String?  // Optional - for guest users
    @@unique([guestSessionId, listingId])
  }
  ```
- **Migration System**: `convertGuestSessionToTrip` action transfers guest data to authenticated trips

### **4. Context System**
- **Guest Context**: `GuestTripContextProvider` manages guest state with real database persistence
- **Optimistic Actions**: Like/dislike actions with rollback on failure
- **Session Data**: Uses browser sessionStorage + cookies for 24-hour guest sessions
- **Auth Prompts**: Strategic prompts when users try to apply to listings

### **5. Component Architecture - Clean Separation**
- **Zero Auth Route Changes**: All authenticated components left completely untouched
- **Guest-Specific Duplicates**: Created isolated guest versions to avoid context conflicts:
  - `guest-search-client.tsx` - Client component split from RSC page
  - `guest-search-match-tab.tsx` - Card-based listing view with auto-advance
  - `guest-search-map-tab.tsx` - Map-based listing view
  - `guest-search-map.tsx` - Interactive map component
  - `guest-search-map-mobile.tsx` - Mobile map overlay (NO auth context)
  - `guest-mobile-map-click-listing-card.tsx` - Mobile map pin cards (NO auth context)
  - `guest-selected-listing-details.tsx` - Desktop map pin details (NO auth context)
  - `guest-filter-display.tsx` - Filter UI
  - `guest-search-listings-grid.tsx` - Grid layout with infinite scroll
  - `guest-search-listing-card.tsx` - Individual listing cards
  - `guest-desktop-map-click-card.tsx` - Map popup cards
  - `guest-listing-details-box-with-state.tsx` - Details sidebar
  - `guest-favorites-tab.tsx` - Saved listings tab
  - `guest-search-favorite-grid.tsx` - Favorites grid view
  - `guest-search-matchbook-tab.tsx` - Sign-in prompt for matches

### **6. Server Actions & Database Integration**
- **Guest Actions**: Created dedicated server actions for guest operations:
  - `guest-favorites.ts` - Like/dislike with database persistence
  - `guest-listings.ts` - Fetch listings for guest sessions
  - `guest-to-trip.ts` - Migration from guest to authenticated
  - `guest-conversion.ts` - Check existing conversions
- **Same Listings Query**: Guests see identical listings as authenticated users
- **Proper Filtering**: Full availability, pricing, and amenity filtering
- **Geographic Search**: Location-based results with distance calculations

## **Key Technical Decisions**

### **Architecture Strategy**
- **React Server Components**: Main page is RSC with client components for interactivity
- **Clean Separation**: Guest components never import authenticated context hooks
- **Component Duplication**: Rather than conditional logic, created separate guest versions
- **Zero Risk**: Authenticated routes completely unaffected by guest implementation

### **Context Isolation**
- **No Shared Components**: Auth components use `useTripContext`, guest use `useGuestTripContext`
- **Custom Snapshots**: Guest components receive snapshot objects as props
- **Database Persistence**: Guest actions save to same tables with `guestSessionId`

### **Auth Strategy**
- **Permissive Browsing**: Let guests like/dislike and see everything
- **Strategic Friction**: Auth prompts only at application stage
- **Session Migration**: Guest data transfers seamlessly when users sign up
- **Server-Side Conversion**: No client-side loading states during sign-up

## **Recent Fixes Completed**

### **Map Interaction Fixes**
- **Problem**: Guest map interactions caused `useTripContext` errors
- **Solution**: Created guest-specific versions of all map components:
  - `guest-search-map-mobile.tsx` - No auth context dependencies
  - `guest-mobile-map-click-listing-card.tsx` - Guest-optimized mobile cards
  - `guest-selected-listing-details.tsx` - Guest-optimized desktop details
- **Result**: Map pins, mobile overlay, and listing details work perfectly for guests

### **Liked Listings Visibility**
- **Problem**: Liked listings disappeared from map view (auto-advance behavior)
- **Solution**: Separated `allListings` (for map) from `swipeListings` (for match tab)
- **Result**: Map shows all listings with heart indicators, match tab auto-advances

## **Current Status**
- ✅ Guest trip creation from home page
- ✅ Full guest search UI with real listings
- ✅ Interactive map with property markers (including mobile)
- ✅ Database-persisted guest likes/dislikes
- ✅ Guest favorites system with migration
- ✅ Server-side conversion (no loading spinners)
- ✅ Context system working without conflicts
- ✅ All map interactions work for guests
- ✅ Auth components completely untouched
- ✅ Clean separation between guest and auth codepaths
