Subject: Eviction Case Details Missing from XML Results (getOrderResults)

Hi,

We're using the "Criminal and Evictions" package and had a question about the XML results from `getOrderResults`. For County Criminal results, the XML includes full case details in `<case>` elements, but for Evictions we only receive this:

<subOrder type="evictions_check" filledCode="hits">
  <time_ordered>2025-12-12 17:01:30</time_ordered>
  <time_filled>2025-12-15 10:41:40</time_filled>
  <fees>...</fees>
</subOrder>

We're able to access the eviction case details just fine via the HTML/PDF reports, but I wanted to confirm we can't get them in the XML before we finalize a PDF workflow.

Example Order: 24776

Here's a sample of our order requests, in case the issue is with our order configuration:

<placeOrder number="MBWEB-76890108">
  <postBackInfo>
    <authentication>...</authentication>
    <URL>https://matchbookrentals.com/api/background-check-webhook</URL>
    <guID>MBWEB-76890108</guID>
    <postback_types>ICR::OCR</postback_types>
  </postBackInfo>
  <subject>...</subject>
  <package>Criminal and Evictions</package>
  <subOrder type="National Criminal"/>
  <subOrder type="evictions_check">
    <state>GA</state>
  </subOrder>
</placeOrder>

Thank you!
