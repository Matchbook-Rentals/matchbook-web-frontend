# Roadmap to Modernize and De-Risk `src/contexts/trip-context-provider.tsx`

A phased plan to enhance performance, maintainability, and reliability of the Trip Context Provider.

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (≤1 day)
- **Remove stray logs**: Eliminate `console.log` statements and introduce a `logger.ts` wrapper to control logging in production.
- **Extract pure helpers**: Move pure functions (`calculateUScore`, `sortListingsByUScore`, date helpers) outside the component, using `useCallback`/`useMemo` only for closures dependent on props.
- **Explicit async types**: Add explicit return types to async actions (e.g., `Promise<void>` → `Promise<Result>`) and tighten dependency arrays (e.g., `[trip.id, …]` instead of entire objects).
- **Immutable state updates**: Replace `Set` copies with `immer` or a utility for O(1) immutable mutations.

## Phase 2: State-Management Hardening (1–2 days)
- **Consolidate state**: Replace multiple `useState` hooks with a single `useReducer` (or `zustand` for a lightweight external store) to formalize state/action separation, prevent stale closures, and simplify the provider.
- **Co-locate optimistic updates**: Move optimistic-update logic to API call files (e.g., `actions/favorites.ts`), allowing the provider to dispatch domain events (e.g., `dispatch({type:"LIKE", id})`).
- **Normalize data**: Convert listings to a map keyed by ID with a list of IDs, collapsing lookup `Set`s into boolean flags on listings.

## Phase 3: Performance & UX (2–3 days)
- **Memoize derivations**: Use `useMemo` for expensive computations (`likedListings`, `matchedListings`, filter results), depending on IDs rather than entire arrays.
- **Separate filter initialization**: Extract filter logic into a `useInitialFilters(tripData)` hook to support SSR and keep the provider lightweight.
- **Adopt React-Query/Next.js**: Integrate React-Query or Next.js server actions for mutations to leverage built-in optimistic updates and rollback, reducing custom error-handling code.
- **Add error handling**: Wrap the provider with `Suspense` and `ErrorBoundary` to gracefully handle failed API calls.

## Phase 4: Type-Safety & Tests (Ongoing)
- **Centralize types**: Move type definitions (`FilterOptions`, etc.) to `/types/trip.ts` and add Zod schemas to validate server payloads.
- **Unit tests**: Write tests for the reducer, covering edge cases like optimistic update failures.
- **Integration tests**: Use React Testing Library to test `like`/`dislike`/`apply` sequences, ensuring state integrity.

## Phase 5: File & API Clean-Up
- **Split responsibilities**: Refactor the ~800 LOC file into three:
  - `trip-reducer.ts`: State management logic.
  - `trip-selectors.ts`: Derived data computations.
  - `TripContextProvider.tsx`: Context wiring.
- **Document context**: Create a README outlining the public context contract, guiding consumers to use selectors over raw state.
- **Optional enhancements**:
  - Introduce a `useTripActions()` hook exposing only action functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - Replace date math with `@date-io` or `luxon` for timezone safety.

## Outcomes
Implementing these changes will:
- Reduce bundle size and re-render frequency.
- Lower maintenance overhead.
- Enable seamless addition of new UX flows, such as multi-device synchronization.








# Trip Context Provider Modernization Checklist

A checklist to modernize and de-risk `src/contexts/trip-context-provider.tsx`.

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (≤1 day)
- [ ] Remove stray `console.log` statements and add `logger.ts` wrapper for production logging control.
- [ ] Extract pure helper functions (`calculateUScore`, `sortListingsByUScore`, date helpers) outside the component, using `useCallback`/`useMemo` only for prop-dependent closures.
- [ ] Add explicit return types to async actions (e.g., `Promise<Result>` instead of `Promise<void>`) and tighten dependency arrays (e.g., `[trip.id, …]`).
- [ ] Replace `Set` copies with `immer` or a utility for O(1) immutable state updates.

## Phase 2: State-Management Hardening (1–2 days)
- [ ] Replace multiple `useState` hooks with a single `useReducer` (or `zustand`) to formalize state/action separation.

- [ ] Memoize expensive derivations (`likedListings`, `matchedListings`, filter results`) with `useMemo`, depending on IDs.
- [ ] Extract filter logic into a `useInitialFilters(tripData)` hook for SSR support and leaner provider.
- [ ] Integrate React-Query or Next.js server actions for mutations, leveraging optimistic updates and rollback.
- [ ] Wrap provider with `Suspense` and `ErrorBoundary` for graceful error handling.

## Phase 4: Type-Safety & Tests (Ongoing)
- [ ] Move type definitions (`FilterOptions`, etc.) to `/types/trip.ts` and add Zod schemas for server payload validation.

## Phase 5: File & API Clean-Up
- [ ] Split ~800 LOC file into:
  - [ ] `trip-reducer.ts` for state management.
  - [ ] `trip-selectors.ts` for derived data.
  - [ ] `TripContextProvider.tsx` for context wiring.
- [ ] Create a README documenting the public context contract, emphasizing selector usage.
- [ ] (Optional) Add `useTripActions()` hook to expose action functions only.
- [ ] (Optional) Replace date math with `@date-io` or `luxon` for timezone safety.
