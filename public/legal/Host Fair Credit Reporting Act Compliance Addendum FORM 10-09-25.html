<h1><b>Host Fair Credit Reporting Act Compliance Addendum</b></h1>

<p>This Host Fair Credit Reporting Act
Compliance Addendum ("<b>Addendum</b>") supplements the MatchBook Terms and
Conditions ("<b>Agreement</b>") between MatchBook, LLC ("<b>MatchBook</b>") and
the undersigned landlord or property owner ("<b>Host</b>").</p>

<p>By checking the acknowledgment box below,
Host agrees to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. § 1681 et
seq.) ("<b>FCRA</b>"), applicable state "<b>Mini-FCRAs</b>," and all related
consumer protection, fair housing, and privacy laws when using renter screening
information through the MatchBook platform.</p>

<h2>1. <b>Purpose and Permissible Use</b>.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Host
certifies that Derived Information (as defined in Section 3), provided by
MatchBook on the platform, will be used solely for the purpose of evaluating
rental applications initiated by the rental applicant ("<b>Applicant</b>").</li>

<li>Host shall not use Derived Information for marketing, solicitation, resale, or any
other unrelated purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. <b>Applicant Authorization Required</b>.</h2>

<p>Host acknowledges and agrees
that only the Applicant authorizes the procurement of a Consumer Report (which
includes credit reports, criminal background checks, and other renter screening
data) in connection with a rental application.</p>

<h2>3. <b>Derived Information Only</b>.</h2>

<ul>
<li><u>Derived Credit Information</u>. Host acknowledges and agrees
that MatchBook will not provide the Host with the Applicant's full Consumer
Report. Instead, MatchBook will provide information generated through
proprietary models that analyze the Applicant's credit score to produce
categorical assessments for rental screening purposes only ("<b>Derived Credit
Information</b>"). By way of example, Derived Credit Information may indicate
an assessment such as "Excellent," "Good," or "Fair." Derived Credit
Information does not disclose, replicate, or substitute for the Applicant's
full Consumer Report or raw credit score.</li>

<li><u>Derived Background Information</u>. Host acknowledges and agrees
that MatchBook will not provide the Host with the Applicant's full background
check report. Instead, MatchBook may provide a limited summary derived from
third-party background information, which may include summary of criminal
history, eviction history, or similar records ("<b>Derived Background
Information</b>"). Such summaries are intended solely for rental screening
purposes and may not include complete or detailed records. Derived Background
Information does not disclose, replicate, or substitute for the Applicant's
full background check or underlying source data.</li>

<li><u>Derived Information</u>. For purposes of this Policy, "<b>Derived
Information</b>" means, collectively, Derived Credit Information and Derived
Background Information. Derived Information is provided solely for use in
evaluating rental applications initiated by Applicants and may not be used for
any other purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. <b>Adverse Action Procedures</b>.</h2>

<p>If
Host takes an Adverse Action (denying an application, requiring higher rent or
deposits, requiring a guarantor, or other unfavorable terms) based in whole or
in part on a Derived Information, Host shall provide the Applicant with an
Adverse Action Notice that includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>The
name, address, and telephone number of the consumer reporting agency (CRA);</li>

<li>A
statement that the CRA did not make the decision and cannot explain the
reasons;</li>

<li>Notice
of the Applicant's right to request a free copy of the Report within 60 days;</li>

<li>Notice
of the Applicant's right to dispute inaccuracies with the CRA; and</li>

<li>A
copy of the CFPB's "Summary of Your Rights Under the Fair Credit Reporting
Act," attached as Appendix A.</li>

<li>Timing:
The notice must be provided at the time of the adverse action or within three
(3) business days of the decision if delivered by mail or electronically.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. <b>Risk-Based Pricing Notice</b>.</h2>

<p>If Host uses Derived Information to offer tenancy
on terms less favorable than those offered to other Applicants (e.g., higher
rent or deposit based on credit risk), Host must provide a Risk-Based Pricing
Notice unless an Adverse Action Notice is already provided.</p>

<h2>6. <b>Information Security and Disposal</b>.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Host
shall implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect
Derived Information.</li>

<li>Access
to Derived Information must be limited to individuals with a legitimate
business need.</li>

<li>Host
is responsible for retaining records of Applicant authorizations and may not
combine FCRA disclosure or authorization forms with unrelated notices or
documents.</li>

<li>Derived
Information and related information must be securely destroyed when no longer
needed, including shredding paper records and securely deleting electronic
files.</li>

<li>In
the event of an actual or suspected data breach, Host must promptly
investigate, mitigate, notify affected Applicants and regulators as required,
and cooperate with MatchBook, CRAs, and law enforcement.</li>

<li>If
Host ever seeks an investigative consumer report (involving interviews with
neighbors, associates, or others), Host must provide additional disclosures and
notices as required under the FCRA and applicable Mini-FCRAs.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. <b>Record Retention</b>.</h2>

<p>Host shall retain:</p>

<ul>
<li>Derived
Information only as long as necessary for the rental application or tenancy;</li>

<li>Applicant
authorizations and disclosures for at least five (5) years or the duration of
tenancy plus seven (7) years, whichever is longer;</li>

<li>Copies
of all Adverse Action or Risk-Based Pricing Notices for at least five (5)
years.</li>

<li>All
retained records must be stored securely and disposed of consistent with
Section 6.</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. <b>Compliance with Related Laws</b>.</h2>

<ul>
<li>Host
shall comply with all applicable federal, state, and local fair housing and
anti-discrimination laws, including the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. § 3601 et
seq.).</li>

<li>Host
shall comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), including providing
specific reasons for denial when required.</li>

<li>Host
shall comply with applicable privacy laws and landlord-tenant laws that affect
the use of Derived Information.</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. <b>Certification and Liability</b>.</h2>

<p>Host certifies that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Derived
Information will be used only for permissible purposes.</li>

<li>Derived
Information will not be used in violation of equal opportunity laws.</li>

<li>Applicant
authorization has been obtained before any consumer credit report is accessed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Host
acknowledges that non-compliance may result in civil liability (including
actual damages, statutory damages, punitive damages, attorney's fees), and
criminal penalties for willful violations.</p>

<p>Host
acknowledges that MatchBook makes no representations or warranties regarding
the accuracy, completeness, reliability, or timeliness of any Derived
Information about an Applicant. Host is solely responsible for verifying any
Derived Information received through MatchBook before making rental decisions.</p>

<p>Host
agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless MatchBook from any claims,
damages, or liabilities arising from Host's failure to comply with the FCRA,
state consumer reporting laws, fair housing laws, this Addendum, or the
Agreement.</p>
