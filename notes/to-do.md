Error: Clerk: The "/platform/trips/e0366d74-2974-403a-bc35-d453a073b94e" route is not a catch-all route. It is recommended to convert this route to a catch-all route, eg: "/platform/trips/e0366d74-2974-403a-bc35-d453a073b94e/[[...rest]]/page.tsx". Alternatively, update the SignIn component to use hash-based routing by setting the "routing" prop to "hash".
