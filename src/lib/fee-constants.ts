/**
 * Fee structure for Matchbook platform
 * 
 * TRANSFER FEE: Flat $5 fee charged for deposit transfers
 *   - Applied to security deposits and pet deposits
 *   - Always a flat rate regardless of deposit amount or trip duration
 * 
 * SERVICE FEE: Percentage-based fee charged on monthly rent
 *   - 3% for trips 6 months or shorter
 *   - 1.5% for trips longer than 6 months
 *   - Applied to the monthly rent amount (base rent + pet rent)
 *   - NOT applied to deposits
 * 
 * CREDIT CARD FEE: Stripe's processing fee (2.9% + $0.30)
 *   - Applied when using credit/debit cards
 *   - No fee for ACH bank transfers
 *   - Uses inclusive calculation to ensure we receive the intended amount
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Stripe Fee Calculation
 * When charging via Stripe, they deduct their fee (2.9% + $0.30) from the total.
 * To ensure we receive the intended amount, we use an inclusive formula:
 *   totalToCharge = (desiredAmount + 0.30) / (1 - 0.029)
 * 
 * Example: If we need $100 after fees:
 *   totalToCharge = (100 + 0.30) / (1 - 0.029) = $103.30
 *   Stripe takes: $103.30 * 0.029 + $0.30 = $3.30
 *   We receive: $103.30 - $3.30 = $100.00 âœ“
