/**
 * Fee structure for Matchbook platform
 *
 * TRANSFER FEE: Flat $7 fee charged for deposit transfers
 *   - Applied to security deposits and pet deposits
 *   - Always a flat rate regardless of deposit amount or trip duration
 *
 * SERVICE FEE: Percentage-based fee charged on monthly rent
 *   - 3% for trips 6 months or shorter
 *   - 1.5% for trips longer than 6 months
 *   - Applied to the monthly rent amount (base rent + pet rent)
 *   - NOT applied to deposits
 *
 * CREDIT CARD FEE: 3% self-inclusive processing fee
 *   - Applied when using credit/debit cards
 *   - No fee for ACH bank transfers
 *   - Self-inclusive calculation ensures we receive the intended amount
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Credit Card Fee Calculation
 * We use a self-inclusive 3% formula:
 *   totalToCharge = baseAmount / (1 - 0.03)
 *
 * Example: If base amount is $227:
 *   totalToCharge = $227 / 0.97 = $234.02
 *   creditCardFee = $234.02 - $227 = $7.02
 *   We receive: $227 âœ“
