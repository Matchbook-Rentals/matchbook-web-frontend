Compliance with Rental Agreements and Property Use.

Payments. Renters are responsible for timely payment of all amounts due under a Booking or Rental Agreement, including rent, the Service Fee, taxes, deposits, and any other disclosed charges. 

Compliance with Rental Agreements and Property Use. By completing a Booking, Renters enter into a Rental Agreement directly with the Host. Renters must comply with all terms of the Rental Agreement, including payment obligations, house rules, cancellation policies, and requirements disclosed in the listing or otherwise agreed upon. Renters must use Properties solely for lawful residential purposes, maintain them in good condition during the stay, and avoid causing damage, nuisance, or disturbances. Renters must not engage in unlawful, hazardous, or disruptive conduct in or around a Property that negatively affects Hosts, neighbors, or the community. Renters may not sublet, assign, or allow unauthorized guests to occupy a Property without the Host’s prior consent. 

Background Checks. Renters acknowledge and agree that MatchBook may facilitate Background Checks as part of the application and Booking process. Renters are solely responsible for authorizing such Background Checks and may consent to reuse an existing report within the Platform. MatchBook will not disclose the results of any Background Check to a Host unless the Renter has provided prior written consent identifying the Host authorized to receive such information.  

Insurance. Renters acknowledge that MatchBook does not provide insurance coverage. Renters are responsible for obtaining any personal, travel, or renters’ insurance appropriate to their stay.  

Service Levels. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, MatchBook shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Platform available in accordance with the service levels. 

Cancellation of Booking. A Booking may be canceled at the request of either the Host or the Renter. MatchBook may process such cancellations through the Platform; however, cancellation of a Booking on the Platform does not terminate, amend, or otherwise relieve either party of their obligations under the applicable Rental Agreement. If cancellation occurs prior to the Renter’s move-in date and MatchBook still holds funds, MatchBook may return such funds to the Renter in its discretion. MatchBook may also, in extraordinary circumstances such as fraud, scams, or material misrepresentation of a Property, process refunds in accordance with Section 11(c)(iii). Security deposits are not held, managed, or returned by MatchBook, and any refund of a security deposit is the sole responsibility of the Host in accordance with applicable law and the Rental Agreement. 

Service Fees. MatchBook charges the Renter a Service Fee, calculated as a Percentage of the total monthly amount due under the Rental Agreement, excluding the deposit. The Percentage may vary based on factors such as Property location, Rental Agreement duration, or other applicable terms. Prior to Booking, the Service Fee is assessed at a monthly rate, included in the total rental payment, and disclosed and itemized at the time of Booking.  

Rent Payments and Payment Terms.  

Rent Payments.  

Rental Payments. When making a Booking, Renters agree to pay all amounts disclosed at checkout, including rent, the Service Fee, taxes, deposits, and any other applicable charges.  

Taxes. Host is solely responsible for reporting and remitting all applicable income, occupancy, lodging, sales, use, or similar taxes. If MatchBook is required to collect or remit taxes on Host’s behalf, it may withhold such amounts from payouts. 

Payment Terms.  

Payment Method. Renter payment credit cards…. 

Payment Processor.  

MatchBook, through Stripe (see Stripe Services Agreement) or another authorized processor, will process payments and transfer the net balance to the Host in accordance of Stripe’s terms and conditions. By completing a Booking, both Host and Renter authorize MatchBook and its processor to verify transaction details for fraud prevention. MatchBook is not a party to, and has no liability for, any payment transactions or disputes between Hosts and Renters. 

All payments between Hosts and Renters, including rent and Service Fees, must be made through the Platform using authorized methods. Neither party may request, offer, or accept cash by mail, instant-cash wire transfers, or any other unauthorized method. Any violation is a material breach and may result in immediate suspension or removal of listings, accounts, or access without notice or refund. MatchBook is not responsible for, and bears no liability for, payments made outside the Platform; the parties engaging in such transactions assume all risk. 

Payment Terms. 

Payment Terms. Subject to clearance by the payment processor, MatchBook will transfer net rental proceeds to Host’s designated account within a commercially reasonable period, typically five (5) to seven (7) business days after receipt. MatchBook may delay or withhold payouts to comply with law, investigate fraud, or address chargebacks or disputes. Refunds, partial refunds, or cancellations are governed by the applicable Rental Agreement and the laws of the state where the Property is located. 

Chargebacks and Reversals. Host is solely responsible for chargebacks, reversals, refunds, or other disputed amounts initiated by a Renter or financial institution. MatchBook may deduct such amounts and related fees from future payouts or debit Host’s account. 

Security Deposits Refund. MatchBook may, in its discretion, process refunds of amounts paid through the Platform in extraordinary circumstances, such as fraud, scams, or material misrepresentation of a Property. MatchBook is not responsible for determining refund eligibility or resolving disputes between Hosts and Renters, except where MatchBook elects to act under this subsection. At the conclusion of a Booking, Hosts are solely responsible for determining the amount of any security deposit to be returned and for returning it directly to the Renter in compliance with applicable laws and the Rental Agreement. MatchBook does not hold, manage, or facilitate the return of security deposits. MatchBook may offset any amounts owed by the Host under this Agreement, including Service Fees, chargebacks, or refunds. 

Accounting Errors.  

Accounting Errors. You must promptly notify MatchBook if: (i) your account has been accessed without authorization; (ii) an unauthorized transaction has occurred; (iii) a transaction was processed incorrectly; or (iv) an account statement contains an inaccuracy (each, an “Error”). Transactions conducted by someone you authorized are not considered Errors unless resulting from fraud, phishing, or a similar exploit. 

Notice Period. Notice of any Error must be provided within sixty (60) days after receipt of the account statement reflecting the Error. MatchBook will investigate within ten (10) business days and correct any Error promptly, or, if additional time is required, may take up to forty-five (45) days (ninety (90) days for new accounts). In such cases, MatchBook will issue a provisional credit within ten (10) business days (twenty (20) business days for new accounts). MatchBook will notify you of the results within three (3) business days after completing its investigation and will provide documentation upon request.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party may disclose Confidential Information to the limited extent required (i) to comply with the order of a court or other governmental body, or as otherwise necessary to comply with applicable law, provided that the party making the disclosure pursuant to the order shall first have given written notice to the other party and made a reasonable effort to obtain a protective order; or (ii) to establish a party's rights under this Agreement, including to make required court filings. Each party's obligations of non-disclosure with regard to Confidential Information are effective as of the date such Confidential Information is first disclosed to the receiving party and will expire five years thereafter; provided, however, with respect to any Confidential Information that constitutes a trade secret (as determined under applicable law), such obligations of non-disclosure will survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement for as long as such Confidential Information remains subject to trade secret protection under applicable law.
