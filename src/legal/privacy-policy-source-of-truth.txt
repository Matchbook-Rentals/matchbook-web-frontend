This policy describes our practices for collecting, using, maintaining, protecting, and disclosing the personal data we may collect from you or that you may provide when you visit our website or other digital properties, communications, or forms that link or refer to this notice (our "Website"). For purposes of this policy, landlords or property managers (“Hosts”) refers to individuals or companies who list rental properties on the Website, and Hosts, tenants, and visitors of the Website (individually and collectively, “you”). 

The Website may include links to third-party websites, plug-ins, services, social networks, or applications. Clicking on those links or enabling those connections may allow the third party to collect or share data about you. We do not control these third-party websites, and we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website you visit or service you enable. 

Please read this notice carefully to understand our policies and practices for processing and storing your personal data. By engaging with our Website, you accept and consent to the practices described in this notice. This notice may change from time to time (see Changes to Our Privacy Notice). Your continued engagement with our Website after any such revisions indicates that you accept and consent to them, so please check the notice periodically for updates. 

Data We May Collect About You 

The personal information we collect, the way we collect it, and how we use it depends on how you interact with us and the services you use. For example, we may collect different information if you submit a rental application, request a credit and background report, register for an account, make a payment through our platform, or otherwise contact or interact with us. We also collect personal data automatically when you interact with our websites and services, and we may obtain personal data from other sources and third parties (such as credit bureaus, background check providers, payment processors, and identity verification services). We collect and use different types of personal data from and about you (“personal data”), including: 

Identifiers: name, mailing address, email address, telephone number, account login credentials (username, and password), and IP address.  

Rental Application Information: current and prior residential addresses, date of birth,  rental application details, employment and income information, identification photos, and financial documentation. 

Property Listing Information (from hosts). details about rental properties provided by Hosts, such as property descriptions, rental terms, photos, amenities, pricing, availability, and any other content submitted for posting on our Website. 

Credit and Background Information: credit report data (including credit scores, tradeline details, inquiries, collections, public records, and employement history), identity verification data, and background check data (including criminal history, eviction records, and other tenant-screening information). Credit report data is used solely for tenant screening purposes and is not disclosed directly to hosts; instead, we may generate derived outputs such as classifications or ranges (e.g., “Excellent,” “Good,” “Fair,” “Poor”) that are shared with hosts. 

Device and Internet Usage Information: device identifiers, browser type, operating system, geolocation information, data, and usage activity on our Website and applications (including pages visited, features used, and interactions with our services). 

Inferences and Derived Information: such as classifications or ranges that we generate internally to assess tenant creditworthiness (e.g., “Excellent,” “Good,” “Fair,” or “Poor”), tenant-screening outcomes, and payment reliability assessments. These outputs may be disclosed to Hosts, but the underlying credit or background reports are not shared. 

Sensitive Personal Information: such as Social Security Numbers or other government identifiers, financial account numbers in combination with access codes or passwords, and criminal history information used in background checks.  

Non-Personal Information: data that does not directly or indirectly reveal your identity or relate to an identified individual, such as statistics or aggregated information. For example, we may aggregate personal data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. If we combine or connect non-personal or technical data with personal data so that it directly or indirectly identifies an individual, we treat the combined information as personal data.  

Website Interaction Information: details about your interactions with our websites, including Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), clickstream data to, through, and from our websites (including date and time), products viewed or searched, page response times, download errors, length of visits to certain pages, page interaction information (such as scrolling, clicks, and mouse-overs), and methods used to navigate away from the page. 

How We Collect Data About You 

We use different methods to collect data from and about you including through: 

Direct Interactions. You may give us information about yourself by filling in forms or by corresponding with us by phone, email, or otherwise. This includes information you provide when you create an account, subscribe to our services, complete a rental application, request a credit or background report, make a payment, participate in discussion boards or other social media functions on our Website, provide a survey or review, contact customer support, or report a problem with our services. The Hosts also provide us with property listing information (such as descriptions, photos, pricing, and availability) when creating or managing listings on our Website. By submitting property details, you understand and agree that this information will be published publicly on our Website and may be viewed by any visitor. 

Automated Technologies or Interactions. As you interact with our Websites and applications, we automatically collect technical and usage data about your device, browsing actions, and patterns. This may include device identifiers, IP address, browser type, operating system, geolocation data, and usage activity. We collect this information through cookies, server logs, analytics tools, and other similar technologies (see Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Technologies). 

Third Parties or Publicly Available Sources. With your authorization, we may obtain information from third parties, including credit bureaus, background check providers, payment processors, identity verification services, business partners, analytics providers, and other vendors that support tenant screening and payment processing. We may also receive information from other sources such as subcontractors that provide technical, payment, or delivery services, advertising networks, search information providers, credit reference agencies, data brokers, aggregators, or publicly available records (such as court filings or government registries). 

User Contributions.  

You may provide information for us to publish or display (“post”) on public Website areas or transmit to other Website users or third parties (collectively, “User Contributions”). This may include reviews, ratings, photos, or comments about your stay, a Host, or a property.  

For the Hosts, User Contributions also include property listings (such as descriptions, photos, amenities, pricing, and availability) that are intended to be made public on our Website. Property listing information is considered content submitted for public display and, once published, is not treated as protected personal data. 

You submit User Contributions for posting and transmission to others at your own risk. Although we limit access to certain pages or you may set certain privacy settings for User Contributions by logging into your account profile, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable. Additionally, we cannot control the actions of other Website users with whom you choose to share your User Contributions. Therefore, we cannot and do not guarantee that unauthorized persons will not view your User Contributions. To protect your privacy, we may display certain User Contributions in an anonymized format (for example, showing only your first name alongside a review). Hosts may view tenant reviews about them or their properties, but they will not have access to the tenant’s full identifying information unless the tenant chooses to include it in the review. 

Cookies and Automatic Data Collection Technologies 

Our Website uses cookies (small files placed on your device) or other automatic data collection technologies to distinguish you from other Website users. This helps us deliver a better and more personalized service when you browse our Website. It also allows us to improve our Website by enabling us to: 

Estimate our audience size and usage patterns. 

Store your preferences so we may customize our Website according to your individual interests. 

Speed up your searches. 

Recognize you when you return to our Website. 

Collect information such as your IP address, device identifiers, browser type, operating system, referring URLs, and usage activity to help us secure our services, prevent fraud, and measure Website performance. 

Analyze trends, evaluate the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, and improve the features and functionality of our Website. 

Provide personalized content, tailor recommendations, and deliver interest-based advertising.  

We also may use these technologies to collect information about your online activities over time and across third-party websites or other online services (behavioral tracking).  

Some web browsers include a “Do Not Track” (“DNT”) feature that sends a signal to websites indicating that you do not wish to be tracked. Because no common standard currently exists on how to interpret DNT signals, our Website does not respond to them. Instead, we provide you with choices to limit behavioral tracking, including opting out of interest-based advertising through the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out page or the Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA) opt-out page, adjusting your browser settings to block cookies, or using controls offered by providers such as Google Ads Settings and Facebook Ad Preferences. 

You may refuse to accept browser cookies by activating the appropriate setting on your browser. However, if you select this setting, certain parts of our Website may become inaccessible and certain features may not work correctly. Unless you adjust your browser settings to refuse cookies, our system will issue them. For detailed information on the cookies we use and the purposes for which we use them, see our Cookie Notice 

Our Website pages and emails may contain web beacons (small transparent embedded images or objects, also known as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us, for example, to count website page visitors or email readers, or to compile other similar statistics such as recording Website content popularity or verifying system and server integrity. 

Third-Party Use of Cookies and Other Tracking Technologies 

Some content or applications, including advertisements, on the Website are served by third parties, including advertisers, ad networks and servers, content providers, and application providers. These third parties may use cookies alone or in conjunction with web beacons or other tracking technologies to collect information about you when you use our Website. They may associate the information collected with your personal data or they may collect information, including personal data, about your online activities over time and across different websites or other online services. They may use this information to provide you with interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content.  

We do not control how these third-party tracking technologies operate or how they may use the collected data. If you have any questions about an advertisement or other targeted content, you should contact the responsible provider directly. For information about how you can opt out of receiving targeted advertising from many providers, see Your Personal Data Use Choices.
