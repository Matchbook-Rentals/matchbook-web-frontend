Privacy Notice for California Residents and Other States 

This Privacy Policy supplements our general Privacy Policy and applies to residents of California as well as individuals in other states that provide comparable privacy rights (including, for example, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Virginia, and additional states as their laws take effect). We adopt this Privacy Policy to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), as well as other state consumer privacy laws that impose similar obligations. Unless otherwise noted, terms defined under the CCPA/CPRA (and comparable state laws) carry the same meaning when used in this Privacy Policy. 

This Privacy Policy provides additional information regarding the categories of personal information we collect, how we use and retain it, whether we sell or share it, and the rights available to residents of these states. We also explain later in this Privacy Policy the choices available to you in exercising your privacy rights.

We collect the categories of personal data described below in order to operate our business and provide services, including processing rental applications, facilitating tenant screening, hosting property listings, enabling communication between tenants and landlords, processing payments, maintaining security, complying with legal obligations, and for the other uses described in our Privacy Policy. 

We collect these categories of personal data from the following sources: directly from you; automatically when you use our Website; from landlords, property managers, and tenants; from third-party service providers such as payment processors, background check providers, and credit bureaus; and from public sources.

We may disclose personal data to service providers and other third parties as described in our Privacy Policy, but such disclosures are made only for business purposes permitted by law, under contracts that limit how the personal data may be used and require the data to be kept confidential.

Right to correct. Request that we correct inaccurate personal data we maintain about you.  

Right to opt out of sale or sharing. Request that we do not “sell” or “share” your personal data, as those terms are defined by law.
